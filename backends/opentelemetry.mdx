## Configuring Generic OpenTelemetry Backend

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines Odigos support sending data to any OTLP destination.
If your destination is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

<Tip>
  Can't find your destination in Odigos? Please tell us! We are constantly
  adding new integrations.
