title: "Telemetry Signals"

Odigos, like OpenTelemetry supports the producing and correlation of the following telemetry signals:

- Distributed traces
- Metrics
- Logs

## Distributed Traces

Distributed trace is a collection of **span**s that describe the execution of a
single request or transaction in your system.
Each span represents a single operation in the handling of the request.

Odigos will automatically record spans that describe operations
for popular packages such as HTTP frameworks, gRPC clients and
servers, Database clients, messaging SDKs and many more.

The collection of traces is achieved by combining two open source technologies:

- OpenTelemetry for languages with JIT compilation such as Python, Java,.NET and
  Javascript. Users can enrich their distributed traces with manually created
  spans by using the relevant
  [OpenTelemetry APIs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).

- eBPF for compiled languages such as Go.

Being based on OpenTelemetry which is a popular open-source standards,
allows Odigos to automatically support a huge number of libraries and frameworks.
Below is a list of supported libraries for every language:

- [Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation)
- [Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation)
- [Go](https://github.com/keyval-dev/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation/tree/master/pkg/instrumentors/bpf)
- [.NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/config.md#instrumented-traces-libraries-and-frameworks)
- [Javascript](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/tree/main/plugins/node)

## Metrics

There are three kinds of metrics that Odigos supports:

- Metrics related to the running of the application (number of HTTP requests,
  latency, DB connections, etc.)
- Metrics related to the language runtime (GC, threads, heap, etc.)
- Metrics related to the host environment (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)

### Applicative Metrics

Application-related metrics are derived from the distributed traces described
above. Many observability vendors automatically compute application metrics
according to the distributed traces. For example, the number of requests served
by the application is computed by counting the number of spans with the
`http.server` label. In case a destination that does not automatically compute
application metrics (like Prometheus + Tempo) is configured, Odigos will compute
them on its own by invoking the
[spanmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/spanmetricsprocessor)
processor.

### Runtime Metrics

Those metrics describe the behavior of the language runtime, such as garbage
collection, threads, heap, etc. Runtime metrics are collected by the same
mechanism that collects distributed traces.

### Host Metrics

Host-related metrics are collected via the
[host metrics receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver)

## Logs

Currently, Odigos will export logs written by the application to the stdout or
stderr of the process. Correlation to other telemetry types will be done
according to timestamp and resource.

We are in the process of shipping logs using the same mechanism that collects
distributed traces, this would allow users to correlate logs to distributed
traces and metrics in a more accurate way.
