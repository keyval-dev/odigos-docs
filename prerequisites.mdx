title: "Local Demo"
description:
  "In this tutorial we are going to use Odigos for generating distributed traces,
  metrics and logs for a demo microservices-based application written in Go, Java, Python, .NET
  and Node.js."
---

To follow the guide, you need the following:

- **A Kubernetes cluster**. We recommend [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for trying Odigos out
  in a local development environment

  Mac users: please avoid using Docker Desktop built-in Kubernetes cluster as it [does not](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation) support bind propagation.

- **[Helm CLI](https://helm.sh)**. We are going to install Odigos using a helm chart.

## Creating the Local Kubernetes cluster

If you choose to use `kind`, create a new local Kubernetes cluster, by running the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

## Deploying the target application

We are going to install a fork of
[microservices-demo](https://github.com/keyval-dev/microservices-demo), an
example of e-commerce application created by Google. We use a modified version
**without any instrumentation code** to demonstrate how Odigos automatically
collects observability data from the application.

Deploy the application using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keyval-dev/microservices-demo/master/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

## Target Application Health

1. Make sure that all the application pods are running (may take a few moments): `kubectl get pods` and check that all pods `STATUS` is "Running".

2. To view the UI of the demo e-commerce application which you just installed by executing

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 3001:80 -n default
```

and then open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser. You should see the
application homepage and be able to interact with it.
